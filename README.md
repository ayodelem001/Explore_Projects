# Explore_Projects

Welcome to my project showcase from my time at Explore! Here, I present three diverse projects that showcase my skills in SQL, PowerBI, and Python, each offering a unique perspective into data analysis and problem-solving.

1. SQL Database Normalization:
Assuming the role of a consultant for a retail company, I undertook the task of normalizing the database for their inventory management system. Given an unnormalized database comprising two tables - products and transactions - I meticulously transformed it into the Third Normal Form (3NF). This project demonstrates my proficiency in database management and optimization.

2. PowerBI Data Analysis:
In this project, I leveraged PowerBI to connect with new data sources related to Eskom's power generation. Through insightful data visualization and analysis, I addressed multiple-choice questions, uncovering valuable insights to support decision-making. This project highlights my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets using cutting-edge tools.

3. Python Language Identification:
South Africa's multicultural society is characterized by its linguistic diversity, with 11 official languages. In this challenge, I developed a Python solution for language identification, a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). By accurately identifying the language of text samples from South Africa's official languages, this project demonstrates my proficiency in NLP and problem-solving.

From normalizing databases to deriving insights from complex datasets and developing NLP solutions, these projects reflect my versatility and expertise in data analysis and programming. I invite you to explore these projects further and discover the depth of my skills and contributions.

Thank you for considering my work.
